This was a homework assignment.

This program is a simple graph data structure program. I didn't finish it before the deadline, it remains incomplete. I had a lot of fun with it.

It takes in a bunch of animals as nodes. The edges are the environment they live in. It prints out the number of nodes and edges. Ideally, it should check to see which animals are neighbors and get the logistics of the graph. Specifically, it checks who is a neighbor, and which animals share a common habitat.
